Johnny Solano - CMPA Website

This is my final attempt at making my website live after researching why it wasn't working and why I was getting a 404. So here we go!

  The purpose of this file and project is to demonstrate my capabilities and resume what I once forgot to do back in school. I have taken many courses on coding and other languages, but I never finished any, so this is a declaration that I can and will resolve all issues that come up and finish this class! I will also be using everything I learn for my future career. I know that I can also learn more for other avenues and work in my field. I have worked on hardware but never on coding, so this is a new language per se but I also know I am not one to give up. I am pushing every part of my knowledge thus far to expand on my ability to learn again. This website will be a roadmap toward my end goal! Thank you for reading.
